This is a project to get working with some advanced ML techniques and technologies. 
Its supposed to be a popularity predictor for a spotify songs dataset, and I am trying
to incorporate different ML stuff in it, like spacy for lang detection, transformers for 
transforming some of the features into numerical ones and so forth. RN its in very
introductory stages, but I plan on running it through a few different models, and incorporate things
like MLflow, some database stuff and APIs in the future. 
Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install dependencies in a venv
